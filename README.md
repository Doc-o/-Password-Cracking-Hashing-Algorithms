# 🔓 Password Cracking and Hashing Algorithms

## 📌 Project Objective
The aim of this project is to understand **password hashing** and demonstrate **brute-force password cracking** using Python.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Hashlib

## 🚀 Concepts Covered
1. **Hashing**
   - Converts a password into a fixed-length string.
   - Example: SHA-256 hash of `abc`.

2. **Brute Force Cracking**
   - Tries every possible combination until the correct password is found.
   - Demonstrated with lowercase alphabets and 3-character passwords.

3. **Salting (Concept)**
   - Adding extra random data before hashing to make cracking harder.

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python cracker.py
